# Pressure solution modelling using IODP data from Expedition 375, Site U1520
Code for recreating and exploring the figures produced for a study on shallow sedimentary stylolites and pressure solution seaward of the Hikurangi Margin.

There are two scripts, one produces stress estimates and performs the modelling of pressure solution (stress_ps_modelling.m), the other calculates the degree of clustering of faults and stylolites (styl_fault_clustering.m).

Data is available from IODP.org or the NERC repository (not yet approved). A zipped datafile is also available on request from the author ( LeahHR[at]cardiff.ac.uk ) for direct use with the scripts once unzipped to a folder named 'data' in the same directory.

By downloading this code, you accept that I am not liable for any effects these scripts may have on anything due to your running them.
